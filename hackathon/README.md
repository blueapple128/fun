# hackathon-cornhacker

Mirror of a rudimentary demo web app written as a portion of Cornell's Digital
Ag Hackathon on March 2, 2019 (https://dahackathon.splashthat.com/). Out of all
the parts of our final submission, some parts were contributed to by everyone
and some parts were written solo due to the timescale; this was the part I
wrote solo. Contains some hacky code due to being created on a hackathon's
timescale. Was originally its own git repo hosted on Cornell's GitHub
Enterprise; made open source with permission.
