# fun

Scripts and stuff that I've written during my free time. Feel free to use.

Contains remote deployment setup for both a Ruby slack bot and a Python slack
bot (sorry for the clutter).

Some of these were written back when I still owned a Windows computer and either
were made to get around Windows limitations, or contain kludges as a result of
Windows behavior.
